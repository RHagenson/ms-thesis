# A simple list of commands that help guide working with subtrees
# Note: the --squash option takes the top commit rather than the entire subtree hitory.

# For the most part, subtreeing is supposed to be painless and "simply works" correctly.
# The manner in which is works is that each directory has its own remote, so we can specifiy which remote to push the latest commit and changes to.
# In the same manner, if changes have been made we can pull from each remote to our local repo.

### Pulling from remote
git subtree pull --prefix=<path/to/code> --squash <subtree-remote-name> master

# Example:
git subtree pull --prefix=python --squash python master

## Pushing to remote
git subtree push --prefix=<path/to/code> --squash <subtree-remote-name> master

# Example:
git subtree push --prefix=python --squash python master
